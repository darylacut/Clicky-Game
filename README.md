# Clicky-Game

This is a memory game created using React. The application's UI is broken up into components and each component state responds to user events. The goal is to click each image only once and avoid clicking any image twice.


### Instructions

1. The application renders different images to the screen, with each image listening for click events.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score, with the score incremented by 1 when clicking an image for the first time. The images currently rendered to the page will then shuffle themselves in a random order.

3. If the user makes an incorrect guess (clicks an image more than once,) the score will reset to 0 and the game will restart.
